An interface designed to simulate taking the GRE circa 2011. The available 
buttons available and behavior is accurate to the way that the GRE worked at
the time. I wrote this app so that I would be able to utilize a written 
practice test but still be able to input answers as if I were taking the 
actual test.

Usage: python mockup.py

Requires python-glade
